# for storing the data in bulk through cli 
# if you are an household wife you dont have bulk data you can do this manually one by one 
# for experimentation purpose i wanted an automated way to send this data in bulk to my database so 
#a separate script like seed_data.py that runs once and inserts all sample records into the database

from config  import get_connection  # Make sure this function is working correctly
